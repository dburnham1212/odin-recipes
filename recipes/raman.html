        <h1>Creamy Chicken Instant Ramen</h1>
        <p>Spruce up that instant chicken ramen by adding actual protein and veggies that yields a creamy broth. 
            This is my take on instant ramen/egg drop soup. 
            Top with chopped chives and crispy wonton strips if desired. 
            They are sold as a salad topping and can be found with croutons.

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package chicken flavored ramen noodles
            </li>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Break up noodles and place in a microwave safe bowl. Add water and frozen veggie mix. Microwave on high 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile whisk egg, mayonnaise, and season packet from the instant ramen together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Temper egg mixture by ladling 1/4 cup of the boiling water from the noodles, whisking until combined. Ladle another 1/4 cup of the boiling water whisking until egg is "cooked" and completely incorporated.</li>
